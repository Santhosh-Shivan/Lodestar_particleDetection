# Lodestar_particleDetection

- Run the multi_particle_LodeSTAR.ipynb file.

- Train_imgs folder contains crops from the real data
- train_images folder contain .npy files of the images that I cropped again to make them more proper. This step is not required if the crops are already good. 
- If new data is used, train the network again with crops from the new data.
- positions.csv contains the coordinates of all the particles for each frame
