# Lodestar_particleDetection

- Run the multi_particle_LodeSTAR.ipynb file.

- Train_imgs folder contains crops from the real data
- Next step is not required if the crops are already good. 
- train_images folder contain .npy files of the images that I cropped again to make them more proper
- If new data is used, make some crops from the images with just a single particle at the center.
